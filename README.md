# Bullshit_Game

This is a mobile application for iOS in which the card game "Bullshit" can be played against an AI.
The goal of this project is to create an AI that is fun to play with due to its human way of acting. 
This actions are computed by a cognitive model which is based on how we think that humans play the game.
